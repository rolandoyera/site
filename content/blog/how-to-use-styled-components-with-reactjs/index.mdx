import { PrimaryButton, SecondaryButton } from "./button.js";

In this article we'll learn how to use styled-components with React.js. Styled-components is a CSS-in-JS library and is not a concept unique to React.js but broadly used in single-page applications such as React.js, Angular.js, etc. It essentially allows you to write CSS as part of your ‚Äúcomponent.‚Äù We‚Äôre going to use styled-components with create-react-app (CRA) to cover some concepts and core functionality.

These concepts will work with any framework using react.js, such as Gatsby.js or Next.js.

If you're in a rush and just want to download the files, [grab it here from my GitHub repo](https://github.com/rolandoyera/styled-components-reactjs-examples).

## Pre-requisites

You‚Äôll have to have some knowledge of React‚Äôs framework, CSS, and styled-components. A small amount of JavaScript understanding will keep you from getting lost, also. If you‚Äôve used create-react-app already, no need to hold you up any longer; let‚Äôs get started.

## Syntax Highlighting & Intellisense

Consider using a syntax highlighting extension for your IDE; I use [vscode-styled-components](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jpoissonnier.vscode-styled-components). Since we‚Äôll be coding CSS-in-JS, this helps tremendously. Have a look at the one I use [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jpoissonnier.vscode-styled-components).

## Environment

First, let‚Äôs install react.js‚Äô create-react-app template, our styled-components dependency, and clean-up the files.

```
npx create-react-app styled-components-starter
```

Next, we‚Äôre going to add our dependencies for our project, which is styled-components.

```
npm install styled-components
```

There are multiple files and images that I remove from the src folder to keep things tidy. This is what remains after the clean-up:

```bash
üì¶ styled-components-starter
 ‚î£ üìÅ node_modules
 ‚î£ üìÅ public
 ‚î£ üìÇ src
 ‚îÉ ‚î£ üìÑ App.js
 ‚îÉ ‚îó üìÑ index.js
 ‚î£ üìÑ .gitignore
 ‚î£ üìÑ package-lock.json
 ‚î£ üìÑ package.json
 ‚î£ üìÑ README.md
 ‚îó üìÑ yarn.lock
```

I removed everything except the app.js and index.js files in the src folder and cleaned-up the code in the app.js file:

<pre className="code-title">src/App.js</pre>
```jsx
function App() {
	return <div>Hello World</div>;
}

export default App;
```

Here's the index.js file:

<pre className="code-title">src/index.js</pre>
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);

```

## Basic Structure

We can create a unique tag naming convention using styled-components that utilizes es6 syntax. We can name the element whatever we like, put some styling on it, and re-use it throughout our project.

This concept makes it easy to read and understand code but, consider how it will render on the client-side. Instead of div tags, consider using section or article tags as wrappers for better structure and accessibility when possible. Doing this makes for good practice, plus search engines and browsers like it.

## Basic Usage

Our CSS syntax with styled-components will use regular kebab-case instead of camel-case, such as `margin-top` instead of `marginTop`. All of the same CSS rules apply here as if we were using a standard CSS stylesheet. We can, and will, use JavaScript inside our CSS, which is powerful and fun to use. This functionality makes it easy for theme application or component state changes.

Let‚Äôs put an h1 tag around our ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù title, and we‚Äôll make a new element called ‚ÄúH1‚Äù. We‚Äôll do this by:

+ importing styled-components
+ creating a JavaScript variable named H1
+ adding CSS to H1
 
Have a look at the code then we‚Äôll discuss it below.

<pre className="code-title">src/App.js</pre>
```jsx
import styled from 'styled-components'

const H1 = styled.h1`
  font-size: 2.5rem;
  font-family: sans-serif;
  text-align: center;
  margin: 2rem 0;
`;

function App() {
  return <H1>Hello World</H1>;
}

export default App;

```

We‚Äôre using the standard JavaScript syntax to assign our variable `const H1`; then, we attach our import ‚Äústyled‚Äù via dot notation to our HTML element, `const H1 = styled.h1`. To encase our CSS, we use ` backticks thanks to JavaScript‚Äôs es6 syntax:

```jsx
const H1 = styled.h1` CSS here `;
```

This would be perfectly acceptable, and is, if we were not exporting the title as a component outside of our file. Meaning, if we had other elements in this file and wanted to export just the title as a component, we could not. This is a perfect segway for using the global styles library from styled-components.

## Global Styles

Functionality for global styles is offered with styled-components, and we‚Äôll make use of it. First, we need to create a separate file and import the `createGlobalStyle` module. We'll also import the `styled` component for our newly created file:

<pre className="code-title">src/GlobalStyle.js</pre>
```jsx
import styled, { createGlobalStyle } from "styled-components";
```

We can use this feature for styling the entire app with global CSS. We‚Äôll do some global styling and move our newly designed ‚ÄúH1‚Äù jsx element from the app.js file. 

What we'll do for our new file:

+ create a new file called GlobalStyle.js
+ import styled and createGlobalStyle from styled-components
+ apply some CSS
+ cut the H1 element from App.js and paste it into this file
+ add the `export` keyword to the H1 code `(export const H1)`
+ create a container component

<pre className="code-title">src/GlobalStyle.js</pre>
```jsx
import styled, { createGlobalStyle } from "styled-components";

export const GlobalStyle = createGlobalStyle`
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  list-style: none;
}
body {
  background-color: #141a2c;
  line-height: 1.5;
  font-size: 1.1rem;
  font-family: sans-serif;
  font-weight: 300;
  color: black;
}
`;
export const H1 = styled.h1`
  font-size: 2.5rem;
  font-family: sans-serif;
  text-align: center;
  color: #ffffff;
  margin: 2rem 0;
`;
export const Container = styled.div`
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  max-width: 800px;
  margin: 0 auto;
`;
```

Now that we‚Äôve seen the code above, notice how we used `export const` this time instead of just const. Using export will allow us to apply and export multiple elements in a file individually. Not to be confused with `export default`. Export default will only allow one component in the file to be exported.

So let‚Äôs now have a look at importing our new components into App.js.

What to do in our App.js file:

+ add an import statement for GlobalStyle, H1, and Container
+ add our new Container to encase our code
+ add our new css component to be rendered `<GlobalStyle />`

<pre className="code-title">src/App.js</pre>
```jsx
import { GlobalStyle, H1, Container } from "./GlobalStyle";

function App() {
  return (
    <Container>
      <GlobalStyle />
      <H1>Hello World</H1>
    </Container>
  )
}

export default App;
```

Have a look at what we‚Äôve done so far, which is not much, but notice how everything is styled without a single stylesheet. We have element-targeted CSS and global CSS coming out of our JavaScript files. That‚Äôs pretty cool.

## How Components & Styled-Components Work

A Styled Component is the combination of an element, JSX, and the CSS rules that style it. Let‚Äôs use the H1 component that we created as an example. We have an element, which is h1, the JSX, which is the coding that allows us to use JavaScript with CSS, and we have our CSS. React will render this in the browser, but we won‚Äôt see the H1 tag we‚Äôve created; we‚Äôll see the HTML h1 (lowercase) tag. A ‚Äúclass‚Äù will be attached to our h1 with a class name generated by React and has no pattern to it; it‚Äôs random.

![Javascript for each loop](./screenshot.jpg)

The `H1` that we see in React is the JavaScript tag that will render HTML, so a proper element needs to be attached to it. When you‚Äôre styling your components or elements with styled-components, keep this in mind. You can use any HTML element like `styled.button`, `styled.div`, `styled.input`, etc. There‚Äôs an exception to this when you‚Äôre extending components. 

## Extending Components & Pseudo Classes

Extending is an easy way to have different variants of your components. It keeps your styling code organized, and it‚Äôll also cut down on the amount of code. An excellent example of trying this would be a button, so let‚Äôs make one, and we‚Äôll also see how to apply pseudo-classes.

Next steps:

+ create a Button.js file in your src folder
+ import styled from styled-components
+ add button syntax and CSS


<pre className="code-title">src/Button.js</pre>
```jsx
import styled from 'styled-components'

export const PrimaryButton = styled.button`
	color: #fff;
	background-color: #0d6efd;
    border:1px solid transparent;
	font-size: 1.1rem;
	padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
	border-radius: 5px;
    margin: 2rem 0;
	transition: all 0.15s;
	&:hover {
		background-color: #3988ff;
		cursor: pointer;
	}
	&:focus {
		color: #fff;
		background-color: #0d6efd;
		border-color: #0d6efd;
		box-shadow: 0 0 0 0.25rem rgba(49, 132, 253, 0.5);
		outline: none;
	}
`;
```

<PrimaryButton> Clickety Click </PrimaryButton>

<br/>
<br/>

Adding pseudo-classes in styled-components uses a syntax that‚Äôs similar to SCSS. We‚Äôll need to nest it and use `&:` to make `&:yourPsuedoClass`. Let‚Äôs now create a secondary button so we can explore extending components.


<pre className="code-title">src/Button.js</pre>
```jsx
import styled from 'styled-components'

export const PrimaryButton = styled.button`
  color: #fff;
  background-color: #0d6efd;
  border:1px solid transparent;
  font-size: 1.1rem;
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
  border-radius: 5px;
  margin: 2rem 0;
  transition: all 0.15s;
	&:hover {
		background-color: #3988ff;
		cursor: pointer;
	}
	&:focus {
		color: #fff;
		background-color: #0d6efd;
		border-color: #0d6efd;
		box-shadow: 0 0 0 0.25rem rgba(49, 132, 253, 0.5);
		outline: none;
	}
`;

export const SecondaryButton = styled(PrimaryButton)`
  color: #0d6efd;
  background-color: transparent;
  margin: 2rem 0;
  &:hover {
    background-color: #3988ff;
    color: #fff;
  }
`;
```

Notice the secondary button method we‚Äôre using, `styled(PrimaryButton)`. Since we‚Äôre extending the original `styled.button`, which uses dot-notation, we need to add a ‚Äúmethod‚Äù or parenthesis instead of the dot to extend it, which is how we arrived at `styled(PrimaryButton)`. If we wanted to add a tertiary button, we could add another method and extend SecondaryButton, `styled(SecondaryButton)`.

Since we‚Äôre extending the primary button, we can only add or change styling that‚Äôs different from the primary. There‚Äôs no removing since we‚Äôre building on top of the original.

Let‚Äôs import it into our App.js file and give it a test drive.

<pre className="code-title">src/App.js</pre>
```jsx
import { GlobalStyle, H1, Container } from "./GlobalStyle";
import { PrimaryButton, SecondaryButton } from './Button'

function App() {
  return (
    <Container>
      <GlobalStyle />
      <H1>Hello World</H1>
      <PrimaryButton>Clickety Click</PrimaryButton>
      <SecondaryButton>Just Click</SecondaryButton>
    </Container>

  )
}

export default App;
```
<PrimaryButton> Clickety Click </PrimaryButton>{" "}

<SecondaryButton>Just Click</SecondaryButton>

<br />
<br />

Not the best-looking secondary, but I think it gets the point across. If you‚Äôre wondering about a tertiary button, here‚Äôs what that code would look like:

```jsx
export const PrimaryButton = styled.button`
// CSS code
`;
export const SecondaryButton = styled.(PrimaryButton)`
// CSS code
`;
export const TertiaryButton = styled.(SecondaryButton)`
// CSS code
`;
```

<br />
<br />

## Extending Components With Props

The official Styled-Components documentation suggests using interpolations as a method to extend components. While helpful, it can be a little limiting. Let‚Äôs code a primary button again, but we‚Äôll use props to extend it.

<pre className="code-title">src/Button.js</pre>
```jsx
import styled from 'styled-components'

export const Button = styled.button`
  color: #fff;
  background-color: ${(props) => (props.secondary ? "#ff7300" : "#0d6efd")};
  border:1px solid transparent;
  font-size: 1.1rem;
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
  border-radius: 5px;
  margin: 2rem 0;
  transition: background-color .25s;
  &:hover {
    background-color: ${(props) => (props.secondary ? "#ff9a47" : "#3988ff")};
	  cursor: pointer;
  } 	&:focus {
    color: #fff;
    background-color: ${(props) => (props.secondary ? "#ffa962" : "#5d9eff")};
    border-color: ${(props) => (props.secondary ? "#ffa962" : "#5d9eff")};
    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0.25rem ${(props) => (props.secondary ? "rgba(255, 184, 52, 0.5)" : "rgba(49, 132, 253, 0.5)")};
    outline: none;
	}
`;

```

There‚Äôs nothing wrong with the props method; it just not as flexible as the extension method for buttons.

To recap, we created an H1 and global CSS component and styled them with styled-components. We also created button components and extended them to make primary and secondary buttons, and we learned how to use pseudo-classes with styled-components. Lastly, we learned how styled-components render the elements in the browser via React.js.

This was fun to make, and I hope this helps you on your JavaScript journey.
