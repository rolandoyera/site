import { FirstStageButton, PrimaryButton, SecondaryButton } from "./button.js";

Styled-components is a CSS in JS library and is not a concept unique to React.js but broadly used in single-page applications such as React.js, Angular.js, etc. It essentially allows you to write CSS as part of your “component.” We’re going to use styled-components with create-react-app (CRA) to cover some concepts and core functionality.

These concepts will work with any framework using react.js, such as Gatsby.js or Next.js.

## Pre-requisites

You’ll have to have some knowledge of React’s framework, CSS, and styled-components. A small amount of JavaScript understanding will keep you from getting lost, also. If you’ve used create-react-app already, no need to hold you up any longer; let’s get started.

## Syntax Highlighting & Intellisense

Consider using a syntax highlighting extension for your IDE; I use [vscode-styled-components](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jpoissonnier.vscode-styled-components). Since we’ll be coding CSS-in-JS, this helps tremendously. Have a look at the one I use [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jpoissonnier.vscode-styled-components).

## Environment

First, let’s install react.js’ create-react-app template, our styled-components dependency, and clean-up the files.

```
npx create-react-app styled-components-starter
```

Next, we’re going to add our dependencies for our project, which is styled-components.

```
npm install styled-components
```

There are multiple files and images that I remove from the src folder to keep things tidy. This is what I’m left with after the clean-up:

```css
📦 styled-components-starter
 ┣ 📁 node_modules
 ┣ 📁 public
 ┣ 📂 src
 ┃ ┣ 📜 App.js
 ┃ ┗ 📜 index.js
 ┣ 📜 .DS_Store
 ┣ 📜 .gitignore
 ┣ 📜 README.md
 ┣ 📜 package.json
 ┗ 📜 yarn.lock
```

I removed everything except the app.js and index.js files in the src folder and cleaned-up the code in the app.js file:

<pre className="code-title">src/App.js</pre>
```jsx
function App() {
	return <div>Hello World</div>;
}

export default App;
```

Here's the index.js file:

<pre className="code-title">src/index.js</pre>
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);

```

## Basic Structure

We can create a unique tag naming convention using styled-components that utilizes es6 syntax. We can name the element whatever we like, put some styling on it, and re-use it throughout our project.

This concept makes it easy to read and understand code but, consider how it will render on the client-side. Instead of div tags, consider using section or article tags as wrappers for better structure and accessibility when possible. Doing this makes for good practice, plus search engines and browsers like it.

## Basic Usage

Our CSS syntax will use regular kebab-case instead of camel-case, such as margin-top instead of marginTop. All of the same CSS rules apply here as if we were using a standard CSS stylesheet. We can, and will, use JavaScript inside our CSS, which is powerful and fun to use. This functionality makes it easy for theme application or component state changes.

Let’s put an h1 tag on our “Hello World” title, and we’ll make a new element called "H1". We’ll do this by importing styled-components and creating a JavaScript variable with it. Have a look at the code then we’ll discuss it below.

<pre className="code-title">src/App.js</pre>
```jsx
import styled from 'styled-components'

const H1 = styled.h1`
font-size: 2.5rem;
font-family: sans-serif;
text-align: center;
`;

function App() {
  return <H1>Hello World</H1>;
}

export default App;

```

We’re using the standard JavaScript syntax to assign our variable const H1; then, we attach our import “styled” via dot notation to our HTML element, h1. To encase our CSS, we use ` backticks thanks to JavaScript’s es6 syntax:

```jsx
const H1 = styled.h1` CSS here `;
```

This would be perfectly acceptable, and is, if we were not exporting the title as a component outside of our file. Meaning, if we had other elements in this file and wanted to export just the title as a component, we could not. This is a perfect segway for using the global styles library from styled-components.

## Global Styles

Functionality for global styles is offered with styled-components, and we’ll make use of it. First, we need to create a separate file and import the module:

<pre className="code-title">src/GlobalStyle.js</pre>
```jsx
import { createGlobalStyle } from "styled-components";
```

We can use this file for styling the entire app, and resetting CSS is one of the things that comes to mind, for me at least. We'll do some global styling and also move our newly designed "H1" jsx element to this file. 

Let start by using the createGlobalStyle name we just imported and apply it as so:

<pre className="code-title">src/GlobalStyle.js</pre>
```jsx
import styled, { createGlobalStyle } from "styled-components";

export const GlobalStyle = createGlobalStyle`
* {
  box-sizing:border-box;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  list-style: none;
}
 body {
  background-color: #141a2c;
  line-height: 1.5;
  font-size: 1.1rem;
  font-family: sans-serif;
  font-weight:300;
  color: black;
}
 `;

export const H1 = styled.h1`
  font-size: 2.5rem;
  font-family: sans-serif;
  text-align: center;
  color: #ffffff;
`;
```

Now that we’ve seen the code above notice how we used `export const` this time instead of just const. Using export will allow you to use multiple elements in a file and export each one individually. Not to be confused with export default. Export default will only allow one component in the file to be exported.

So let’s now have a look at exporting our GlobalStyle and our H1 into our App.js file.

<pre className="code-title">src/App.js</pre>
```jsx
import { GlobalStyle, H1 } from "./GlobalStyle";

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <GlobalStyle />
      <H1>Hello World</H1>
    </>
  )
}

export default App;
```

## Naming Our Components

A Styled Component is the combination of an element and the CSS rules that style it. Your regular h1 element will need to be named something different and follow es6 syntax guidelines. For example:

```jsx
const Title = styled.h1`
	font-size: 2rem;
`;
```

In the code above, we’re declaring “Title” as our variable, which is equal to our new styled.h1 and the CSS rules that follow it. Let’s have a look at this in the React.js application.

Let’s use this for our nifty “Hello World,” also, we will import styled-components and make a title component using the h1 element as we previously discussed.

<pre className="code-title">src/App.js</pre>
```jsx
import { GlobalStyle } from "./GlobalStyle";
import styled from "styled-components";

const Title = styled.h1`
	font-size: 2rem;
`;

function App() {
	return (
		<div>
			<GlobalStyle />
			<Title>Hello World</Title>
		</div>
	);
}

export default App;
```

For this use case, we’re going to need a container for our title, and those div tags that are not doing anything at the moment will be perfect. Let’s style a “header” element that will serve as our header for proper mark-up and contain our title.

```jsx
// App.js

import { GlobalStyle } from "./GlobalStyle";
import styled from "styled-components";

const Title = styled.h1`
	font-size: 2rem;
`;

const Header = styled.header`
	max-width: 800px;
	margin: 0 auto;
`;

function App() {
	return (
		<div>
			<GlobalStyle />
			<Header>
				<Title>Hello World</Title>
			</Header>
		</div>
	);
}

export default App;
```

What we have above are styled-components and their primary use case. We have two elements that we’ve styled, an h1 and a header element, and we’ve named them appropriately. Now that we’re comfortable with the syntax let’s keep going with our styles.

## Pseudo Classes

Let’s make an example button for this pseudo-class section. To make it interactive, we’ll have to use the hover and active pseudos, so it’ll be perfect. Let’ start with the button.

```jsx
const Button = styled.button`
	color: #fff;
	background-color: #0d6efd;
	font-size: 1.1rem;
	padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
	border-radius: 5px;
`;
```

<FirstStageButton> Button </FirstStageButton>

<br />
<br />

We’ve added a button, but it’s not very interactive. To add a hover class using styled-components, we’ll have to add it similar to SCSS. We’ll need to nest it and use &:hover or &:yourPsuedoClass as follows:

```jsx
const Button = styled.button`
	color: #fff;
	background-color: #0d6efd;
	font-size: 1.1rem;
	padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
	border-radius: 5px;
	transition: background-color 0.15s;
	&:hover {
		background-color: #3988ff;
		cursor: pointer;
	}
	&:focus {
		color: #fff;
		background-color: #0d6efd;
		border-color: #0d6efd;
		box-shadow: 0 0 0 0.25rem rgba(49, 132, 253, 0.5);
		outline: none;
	}
`;
```

<PrimaryButton> Button </PrimaryButton>

<br />
<br />

That’s better. There’s a lot of power by using this functionality, and we’ll make use of it a little later. Let’s extend our button and make a secondary variant.

## Extending Classes for Different Variants

Extending is an easy way to have different variants of your components. It keeps your styling code organized, and it’ll also cut down on the amount of code. Let’s make two different variants from our button component and make a primary and secondary button.

First, I’ll change the Button name we just created to “PrimaryButton” and add another JavaScript variable and call it SecondaryButton. So this is what we have for or two buttons so far:

```jsx
export const PrimaryButton = styled.button`
	color: #fff;
	background-color: #0d6efd;
	font-size: 1.1rem;
	padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
	border-radius: 5px;
	transition: background-color 0.15s;
	&:hover {
		background-color: #3988ff;
		cursor: pointer;
	}
	&:focus {
		color: #fff;
		background-color: #0d6efd;
		border-color: #0d6efd;
		box-shadow: 0 0 0 0.25rem rgba(49, 132, 253, 0.5);
		outline: none;
	}
`;

export const SecondaryButton = styled(PrimaryButton)``;
```

Notice the SecondaryButton method we’re using, styled(PrimaryButton). Since we’re extending the original styled.button, which uses dot-notation, we need to add a “method” to extend it, which brings us to styled(PrimaryButton). If we wanted to add a tertiary button, we could add a third method and extend SecondaryButton, styled(SecondaryButton).

Let's add some styling to the SecondaryButton:

```jsx
export const PrimaryButton = styled.button`
	color: #fff;
	background-color: #0d6efd;
	font-size: 1.1rem;
	padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
	border-radius: 5px;
	transition: background-color 0.15s;
	&:hover {
		background-color: #3988ff;
		cursor: pointer;
	}
	&:focus {
		color: #fff;
		background-color: #0d6efd;
		border-color: #0d6efd;
		box-shadow: 0 0 0 0.25rem rgba(49, 132, 253, 0.5);
		outline: none;
	}
`;

export const SecondaryButton = styled(PrimaryButton)`
	color: #0d6efd;
	background-color: white;
	&:hover {
		background-color: #3988ff;
		color: #fff;
	}
`;
```

Since we’re expanding on the first button, we only add styling that’s different from the primary. Here’s the secondary button:

<PrimaryButton> Primary </PrimaryButton>{" "}

<SecondaryButton>Secondary</SecondaryButton>

<br />
<br />

Not the best-looking secondary, but I think it gets the point across. If you’re wondering about a tertiary button, here’s what that code would look like:

```jsx
export const PrimaryButton = styled.button`
// CSS code
`;
export const SecondaryButton = styled.(PrimaryButton)`
// CSS code
`;
export const TertiaryButton = styled.(SecondaryButton)`
// CSS code
`;
```

<br />
<br />

## Extending Components Versus Props

The official Styled-Components documentation suggests using interpolations as a method to extend components. While helpful, there are some cons associated with that method for its use with buttons.

Here’s the code they suggest for a secondary button:

```jsx
const Button = styled.button`
	/* Adapt the colors based on primary prop */
	background: ${(props) => (props.primary ? "palevioletred" : "white")};
	color: ${(props) => (props.primary ? "white" : "palevioletred")};

	font-size: 1em;
	margin: 1em;
	padding: 0.25em 1em;
	border: 2px solid palevioletred;
	border-radius: 3px;
`;

render(
	<div>
		<Button>Normal</Button>
		<Button primary>Primary</Button>
	</div>
);
```

A minor fixable issue is that they show “primary,” which should be “secondary.” What would you do with a “normal” button other than using it as a primary? Other than that, hover, and other pseudo-classes are nestable but seem a little trickier. It’s limiting, in this case, to use interpolation to be able to add a “primary” prop. Don’t get me wrong; it’s useful if we want a secondary anything.
