import {Toggle, ToggleOpen, ToggleReplace} from "./Toggle";

Easily and quickly target any HTML element’s CSS class with a couple of lines of simple vanilla Javascript. With this method, you can hide and show a div or toggle between two classes. 

Toggling CSS is a must and very simple to implement with JavaScript. In this example, there are three things that we’re going to focus on, a button, a function to target and toggle the element, and lastly, the statement that will allow us to toggle CSS with JavaScript.

## Example

<Card>
	<Toggle />
</Card>

<br />
<br />

## The Button

Let's start by targeting our button and we'll access it by its id with the `getElementById()` method. For brevity, we’ll name the button “theButton,” but you can call it whatever you’d like and pass it as a parameter.

<pre className="code-title">scripts/index.js</pre>
```js
document.getElementById("theButton");
```

Our button is on the ready so next we have to add a method to listen for the click on the button. We’ll use the `addEventListener()` method and pass “click” as a parameter.

<pre className="code-title">scripts/index.js</pre>
```js
document.getElementById("theButton").addEventListener("click");
```

To recap this section, we're accessing our code via the "document" object then passing two methods to it via dot notation. The first method, getElementById, allows us to access our button by its "id." The second method, addEventListener, will listen for an event in our document, a click.

## The Function

Next, we’re going to implement our function. We have to name our function, and again, for brevity, we’ll name our function “theFunction,” but you can name it whatever you’d like and pass it as a parameter next to “click.”

<pre className="code-title">scripts/index.js</pre>
```javascript
document.getElementById("theButton").addEventListener("click", theFunction);
function theFunction() {}
```

## The Statement

We still have to choose a target and assign a variable to it. We’re going to do this inside the function, so the variable is only available to this function and will not get executed by any other functions. This is called a locally scoped variable, and scope determines the accessibility of variables to the function. We’re going to use “x” as our variable name and once again use the `getElementById()` method and assign “theTarget” as our id.

<pre className="code-title">scripts/index.js</pre>
```js
document.getElementById("theButton").addEventListener("click", theFunction);
function theFunction() {
	let x = document.getElementById("theTarget");

}
```

We’re going to use the if…else statement here to toggle our CSS class. The if...else is a conditional statement that executes given a specified condition.The if…else is straightforward to implement; if our class has “x,” then show “y”; else, if “y” is present, show “x.” If you want to learn more about the JavaScript if...else statement [read this article](https://javascriptarticles.com/javascript-if-else-statement/ "JavaScript If...else Statement"). Lastly, we’ll use “styleOne” and “styleTwo” as our class names to toggle.

<pre className="code-title">scripts/index.js</pre>
```js
document.getElementById("theButton").addEventListener("click", theFunction);
function theFunction() {
	let x = document.getElementById("theTarget");
	if (x.className === "styleOne") {
		x.className = "styleTwo";
	} else {
		x.className = "styleOne";
	}
}
```

We can then use an arrow function to eliminate redundancy like this:

<pre className="code-title">scripts/index.js</pre>
```js
document.getElementById('theButton').addEventListener('click',
  (theFunction = () => {
    let x = document.getElementById('theTarget')
    if (x.className === 'styleOne') {
      x.className = 'styleTwo'
		} else {
			  x.className = 'styleOne'
			}
	}))
```

And there’s you’re complete function. To recap, we used a button and listened for a click to target our element. We used a locally scoped variable and used the if…else statement to toggle our CSS classes. Here’s the complete code with HTML and CSS.

<pre className="code-title">src/index.html</pre>
```html
<style>
	.styleOne {
    display: none !important;
	}
	.styleTwo {
		width: 100%;
		padding: 25px;
		background-color: coral;
		color: white;
		font-size: 25px;
		box-sizing: border-box;
		text-align: center;
	}
</style>

<button class="btn btn-primary" id="theButton">Toggle Me</button>

<div style="height: 130px;">
	<div class="styleOne" id="theTarget">
		This is a CSS toggle targeted element.
	</div>
</div>

<script>
  document.getElementById('theButton').addEventListener('click',
  (theFunction = () => {
    let x = document.getElementById('theTarget')
    if (x.className === 'styleOne') {
      x.className = 'styleTwo'
		} else {
			  x.className = 'styleOne'
			}
	}))
</script>
```

<br />
<br />

## Using toggle( )

Alternatively, you can use the ```toggle()``` method to add an additional class. For instance, if you were toggling an accordion or dropdown, you could use ```.open``` or ```.active```. 

## Example

<ToggleOpen />


<br />
<br />

The code looks very similar, but we replace the if...else statement with the toggle method. In this case, ```.open``` is added and removed to an already existing class. With this method, your additional class can have a different height to open or expand the element.

<pre className="code-title">scripts/index.js</pre>
```js
document.getElementById('theButton').addEventListener(
	'click',
	(theFunction = () => {
		let x = document.getElementById('theTarget')
		x.classList.toggle('open')
	})
)
```

<br />
<br />

## Using replace( )

This method would be ideal for a modal or pop-up. On page load, it's visible, but once it's clicked, it's hidden. This is just one of the many ways you can use the replace method.


## Example

<ToggleReplace />

<br />
<br />

Using ```.replace()``` will require two arguments, your initial class, and a class to replace it. This method will not toggle the classes back and forth; it's a one-shot deal.  

The code is identical to the toggle method. Just replace ```.toggle``` with ```.replace``` and make sure two arguments are listed; otherwise, you'll get an error.



<pre className="code-title">scripts/index.js</pre>
```js
document.getElementById('theButton').addEventListener(
	'click',
	(theFunction = () => {
		let x = document.getElementById('theTarget')
		x.classList.replace('style', 'close')
	})
)
```

<br />
<br />

That's all for now. I hope this helps you on your learning journey.
