import ToolTip from "./ToolTip";



Tooltips have been one of those components that have flown under the radar for me. I've never given it much thought until I was working on a project recently and needed to use one. SEO was of upmost importance and after some fiddling around with it, I relized that they're not that many solid options to build one. After A LOT of research and rabbit holes, this is what I came up with:
<br />

<ToolTip />

<br />

The awesome thing about these is that they're SEO friendly and use nothing but CSS. Have a look at the code:

<br />

```html
<button 
  class="btn btn-primary" 
    tooltip="Tooltip up here!" 
      flow="up">
        Up
</button>
```
<br />

As you can see, the "tooltip" attribute holds the text and doesn't interfere with the document flow. Most tooltips require tags.

```jsx:title=src/components/post.jsx {5-7,10}
import React from "react";

const Post = ({ data: { post } }) => (
  <Layout>
    <Heading variant="h2" as="h2">
      {post.title}
    </Heading>
    <p
      sx={{
        color: `secondary`,
        mt: 3,
        a: { color: `secondary` },
        fontSize: [1, 1, 2],
      }}
    >
      <span>{post.date}</span>
      {post.tags && (
        <React.Fragment>
          {` â€” `}
          <ItemTags tags={post.tags} />
        </React.Fragment>
      )}
    </p>
    <section
      sx={{
        ...CodeStyles,
        my: 5,
        ".gatsby-resp-image-wrapper": { my: 5, boxShadow: `lg` },
      }}
    >
      <MDXRenderer>{post.body}</MDXRenderer>
    </section>
  </Layout>
);

export default Post;
```

Code block without title:

```
Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone
```

Code block without lineNumbers (but lang):

```text noLineNumbers
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets
```

Code block without lineNumbers (and without lang):

```noLineNumbers
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets
```

Code block with only the title:

```:title=src/utils/scream.js
const scream = (input) => window.alert(input)
```

Code block with only the title but without lineNumbers:

```:title=src/utils/scream.js noLineNumbers
const scream = (input) => window.alert(input)
```

Line highlighting without code title:

```js {2,4-5}
const test = 3;
const foo = "bar";
const harry = "potter";
const hermione = "granger";
const ron = "weasley";
```

Here will `inline code` go, just inside the text. Wow!

Code block without line numbers but with highlighting, language, and title:

```tsx:title=src/components/blog.tsx {7-9,16} noLineNumbers
import React from "react";

const Blog = ({ posts }: PostsProps) => {
  const { tagsPath, basePath } = useSiteMetadata();

  return (
    <Layout>
      <Flex sx={{ alignItems: `center`, justifyContent: `space-between` }}>
        <Heading variant="h2" as="h2">
          Blog
        </Heading>
        <Styled.a
          as={Link}
          sx={{ variant: `links.secondary` }}
          to={`/${basePath}/${tagsPath}`.replace(/\/\/+/g, `/`)}
        >
          View all tags
        </Styled.a>
      </Flex>
      <Listing posts={posts} sx={{ mt: [4, 5] }} />
    </Layout>
  );
};

export default Blog;
```
