import ToolTip from "./ToolTip";



I've never given tooltips much thought until I worked on a project recently and needed to use one. I realized that they're not that many solid options to build one, and after A LOT of research and rabbit holes, this is what I came up with:
<br />

<ToolTip />

<br />

The awesome thing about these is that they're SEO friendly and use nothing but CSS. Have a look at the code:

<br />

```html
<button class="btn" tooltip="Tooltip up here!" flow="up">
  Up
  </button>
  <button class="btn" tooltip="Tooltip down way over here!" flow="down">
  Down
  </button>
  <button class="btn" tooltip="This one is a lefty with a really long sentence!" flow="left">
  Left
  </button>
  <button class="btn" tooltip="Tooltip right" flow="right">
  Right
</button>
```
<br />

As you can see, the "tooltip" attribute holds the text for your tooltip and doesn't interfere with the document flow. Most tooltips require `span` tags to store your information you want to display. How will a search engine know you're using a tooltip with span tags or will it think that your information is terrible and not consider the page for search?
