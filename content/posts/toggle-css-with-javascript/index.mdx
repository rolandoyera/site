import Toggle from './Toggle'


Easily target any HTML element's CSS class with a couple of lines of simple Javascript. This can serve many use cases such as hidding an element with a <code>.hidden</code> class or triggering an element with an <code>.active</code> or <code>.inactive</code> class.

### Example

### Toggling CSS

Toggling CSS is a must and very simple to implement with JavaScript. In this example, there are three things that we’re going to focus on, a button, a function to target and toggle the element, and lastly our statement to toggle the CSS classes.

### The Button 

We’re going first to query the button and access it by its id with the `getElementById()` method. For brevity, we’ll name the button “theButton,” but you can call it whatever you’d like and pass it as a parameter.

```js
document.getElementById("theButton")
```

Next, we have to add a method to listen for the click on the button. We’ll add the `addEventListener()` function method to the code and pass “click” as a parameter.

```js
document.getElementById("theButton").addEventListener("click")
```

### The Function

Next, we’re going to implement our function. We have to name our function, or we can make it anonymous. Again, for brevity, we’ll name our function and leave anonymous functions for another time. We’re going to call our function “theFunction,” but you can name it whatever you’d like and pass it as a parameter also next to “click.”

```javascript
document.getElementById("theButton").addEventListener ( 
  "click", theFunction )
  function theFunction() {
}
```

### The Statement

We’re going to use the if…else statement here to toggle our CSS class. The if…else statement is straightforward to implement; if our class has “x,” then show “y”; else, if “y” is present, show “x.”

We still have to choose a target and assign a variable to it. We’re going to do this inside the function, so the variable is only available to this function and will not get executed by any other functions. This is a locally scoped variable, and scope determines the accessibility of variables to the function. We’re going to use “x” as our variable and once again use the `getElementById()` method and assign “theTarget” as our id.

Lastly, we’ll use “styleOne” and “styleTwo” as our class names to toggle.

```js {4-8}
document.getElementById("theButton").addEventListener (
  "click", theFunction )
  function theFunction() {
    let x = document.getElementById("theTarget");
    if (x.className === "styleOne") {
        x.className = "styleTwo";
    } else {
        x.className = "styleOne";
  }
}
```

And there’s you’re complete function. To recap, we used a button and listened for a click to target our element. We used a locally scoped variable and used the if…else statement to toggle our CSS classes. Here’s the complete code with HTML and CSS.



```html
<style>
.styleOne {
	width: 100%;
	padding: 25px;
	background-color: coral;
	color: white;
	font-size: 25px;
	box-sizing: border-box;
	text-align: center;
}
.styleTwo {
	display: none !important;
}
</style>

<button class="btn btn-primary" id="theButton">Toggle Me</button>

<div style="height: 130px;">
  <div class="theFirstStyle" id="theTarget">
    This is a CSS toggle targeted element.
  </div>
</div>

<script>
document.getElementById("theButton").addEventListener("click", theFunction)
  function theFunction() {
    let x = document.getElementById("theTarget");
    if (x.className === "styleOne") {
        x.className = "styleTwo";
    } else {
        x.className = "styleOne";
  }
}
</script>
```
